# WashCubes Admin Dashboard
WashCubes is a smart laundry locker mobile application that allows users to engage laundry services through the use of smart lockers. There are two different interfaces, operator and admin.

In the operator dashboard, laundry operators will manage and process incoming / outgoing orders at the laundry site. They will verify order volume and update order status as the laundry is being processed. In the admin dashboard, admins can view all ongoing orders including the order details and status, and they can view locker availability for each location.

The web-based admin dashboard is made using Flutter and integrates with Node.js and MongoDB backend.

This user app is a part of the WashCubes system which also consists of a rider app, admin dashboard, and the backend system itself. The repositories can be viewed as follows: <br>
